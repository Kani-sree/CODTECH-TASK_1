Overview of the Project
This project analyzes a breast cancer dataset to identify the most significant features for diagnosis using feature importance techniques and visualization tools. It helps to uncover patterns and correlations within the data, aiming to support accurate predictions of breast cancer diagnoses.

Project Name:
Breast Cancer Diagnosis Feature Analysis

Objective:
The primary objective is to analyze the relationships between various features in the dataset and their significance in predicting breast cancer diagnoses. It involves:

Identifying important features using a Random Forest model.
Visualizing data relationships to better understand patterns.
Supporting the development of predictive models for accurate diagnosis.
Key Activities:
Data Preprocessing:

Loading the breast cancer dataset.
Label encoding categorical variables.
Scaling numerical features for consistent analysis.
Dropping irrelevant columns like id.
Feature Importance Analysis:

Using Random Forest Classifier to calculate feature importances.
Ranking features based on their contribution to diagnosis prediction.
Visualization:

Generating a correlation heatmap to understand relationships among features.
Creating pair plots for the top 5 important features.
Plotting a scatter plot for the top 2 features.
Displaying histograms of the top 10 features categorized by diagnosis type.
Insights and Interpretation:

Extracting insights from visualizations to understand feature contributions.
Highlighting the most important factors influencing breast cancer diagnosis.
